	abstract = {Forecasting is a common data science task that helps organizations with capacity planning, goal setting, and anomaly detection. Despite its importance, there are serious challenges associated with producing reliable and high quality forecasts — especially when there are a variety of time series and analysts with expertise in time series modeling are relatively rare. To address these challenges, we describe a practical approach to forecasting “at scale” that combines configurable models with analyst-in-the-loop performance analysis. We propose a modular regression model with interpretable parameters that can be intuitively adjusted by analysts with domain knowledge about the time series. We describe performance analyses to compare and evaluate forecasting procedures, and automatically flag forecasts for manual review and adjustment. Tools that help analysts to use their expertise most effectively enable reliable, practical forecasting of business time series.},

stochastic, neural networks and support vector machines are studied together with their inherent forecasting strengths and weaknesses. The book also meticulously discusses about several basic issues related to time series analysis, such as stationarity, parsimony, overfitting, etc. Our study is
enriched by presenting the empirical forecasting results, conducted on six real-world time series datasets. Five performance measures are used to evaluate the forecasting accuracies of different models as well as to compare the models. For each of the six time series datasets, we further

	abstract = {Defending against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks in the Internet is a fundamental problem. One practical approach to addressing DDoS attacks is to redirect all destination (e.g., via DNS or BGP) to a third-party, DDoS protection-as-a-service provider (e.g., Cloudflare and Akamai), which is well provisioned and equipped with proprietary filtering mechanisms to remove attack traffic before passing the remaining traffic to the destination. Although such an approach is appealing, as it requires no modification to the existing Internet infrastructure and can scale to handle very large attacks, recent industrial interviews with more than 100 interviewees from over 10 industry segments reveal that this approach alone is not sufficient, especially for large organizations (e.g., Web hosting companies and government) that cannot afford to allow third-parity security-service providers to terminate their network connections. Instead, these organizations have to rely on their ISPs to filter attack traffic. In this paper, we discuss the challenges faced by the ISPs in order to disrupt the Internet security-service market and sketch our solutions, powered by smart contracts.},

Unfortunately, traditional DDoS defenses are incapable of stopping such attacks and recently proposed software-defined solutions are ineffective. In this work, we observe a new opportunity for mitigating LFAs using optical networking advances. In essence, we envision new capabilities for topology programming, to scale capacity on-demand to avoid congestion and add new links to the network to create new paths for traffic during LFA incidents. Realizing these benefits of optical topology programming raises unique challenges; the search space for candidate topology configurations is very large and joint optimization of topology and routing is NP-hard. We present ONSET—a framework that tackles these challenges to lay a practical foundation for topology programming-based defenses against LFAs. We show that ONSET complements existing programmable network defenses and amplifies their benefits. We perform a what-if style analysis of ONSET by simulating a wide-ranging set of attacks, including terabit-scale attacks against every single link, on five networks with two different routing capabilities and observe that ONSET provides the means to mitigate congestion loss in more than 90\% of the hundreds of diverse attack scenarios considered.},

Currently, traditional attack detection methods are mainly used to detect whether a DDoS attack occurs and it is difficult to find the path that the attack flow traverses the network, which makes it difficult to accurately mitigate DDoS attacks. In this article, we propose a detection method based on Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) over the data plane programmable SDN, which maps the network into a graph. It senses the state of switches through In-band Network Telemetry (INT) with sampling, inputs the network state into the spatial-temporal graph convolutional network detection model, and finally finds out the switches through which DDoS attack flows pass. Based on this, we propose a defense method combined with an enhanced whitelist and a precise dropping strategy, which can effectively mitigate DDoS attacks and minimize the impact on legitimate network traffic. The evaluation results show that our detection method can accurately detect the path that the DDoS attack flows pass through, and can effectively mitigate the DDoS attack. Compared to classic methods, our method improves the detection accuracy by nearly 10\%. At the same time, the southbound interface load and CPU overhead brought by our detection and defense process are much lower than the classic methods.},

Though IP traceback and path inference approaches could be considered, they are either expensive and hard to deploy or inaccurate. We propose PathFinder, a service that a DDoS defense system can use to obtain the footprints of the DDoS traffic to the victim. PathFinder employs an architecture that is easy to implement and deploy on today's Internet, a PFTrie data structure that introduces multiple design features to log traffic at line rate, and streaming and zooming mechanisms that facilitates the storage and transmission of DDoS footprints more efficiently. Our evaluation shows that PathFinder can significantly improve the efficacy of a DDoS defense system, its PFTrie data structure is fast and has a manageable overhead, and its streaming and zooming mechanisms significantly reduce the delay and overhead in transmitting DDoS footprints.},

	abstract = {Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks represent a persistent threat to modern telecommunications networks: detecting and counteracting them is still a crucial unresolved challenge for network operators. DDoS attack detection is usually carried out in one or more central nodes that collect significant amounts of monitoring data from networking devices, potentially creating issues related to network overload or delay in detection. The dawn of programmable data planes in Software-Defined Networks can help mitigate this issue, opening the door to the detection of DDoS attacks directly in the data plane of the switches. However, the most widely-adopted data plane programming language, namely P4, lacks supporting many arithmetic operations, therefore, some of the advanced network monitoring functionalities needed for DDoS detection cannot be straightforwardly implemented in P4. This work overcomes such a limitation and presents two novel strategies for flow cardinality and for normalized network traffic entropy estimation that only use P4-supported operations and guarantee a low relative error. Additionally, based on these contributions, we propose a DDoS detection strategy relying on variations of the normalized network traffic entropy. Results show that it has comparable or higher detection accuracy than state-of-the-art solutions, yet being simpler and entirely executed in the data plane.},

Their capability to incapacitate network services while causing millions of dollars in damages has made effective DDoS detection and prevention imperative for businesses and government entities alike. Prior research has found shallow and deep learning classiﬁers to be invaluable in detecting DDoS attacks; however, there is an absence of research concerning time-based features and classiﬁcation among many DDoS attack types. In this article, we propose and study the efﬁcacy of 25 time-based features to detect and classify 12 types of DDoS attacks using binary and multiclass classiﬁcation. Furthermore, we ran experiments to compare the performance of eight traditional machine learning classiﬁers and one deep learning classiﬁer using two different scenarios. Our ﬁndings show that the majority of models provided ∼99\% accuracy on both the control and time-based experiments in detecting DDoS attacks while yielding ∼70\% accuracy in classifying speciﬁc DDoS attack types. Training on the proposed time-based feature subset was found to be effective at reducing training time without compromising test accuracy; thus, the smaller time-based feature subset alone is beneﬁcial for near-real time applications that incorporate continuous learning.},

	abstract = {Network traffic monitoring based on IP Flows is a standard monitoring approach that can be deployed to various network infrastructures, even the large ISP networks connecting millions of people. Since flow records traditionally contain only limited information (addresses, transport ports, and amount of exchanged data), they are also commonly extended by additional features that enable network traffic analysis with high accuracy. These flow extensions are, however, often too large or hard to compute, which then allows only offline analysis or limits their deployment only to smaller-sized networks. This paper proposes a novel extended IP flow called NetTiSA (Network Time Series Analysed) flow, based on analysing the time series of packet sizes. By thoroughly testing 25 different network traffic classification tasks, we show the broad applicability and high usability of NetTiSA flow. For practical deployment, we also consider the sizes of flows extended by NetTiSA features and evaluate the performance impacts of their computation in the flow exporter. The novel features proved to be computationally inexpensive and showed excellent discriminatory performance. The trained machine learning classifiers with proposed features mostly outperformed the state-of-the-art methods. NetTiSA finally bridges the gap and brings universal, small-sized, and computationally inexpensive features for traffic classification that can be scaled up to extensive monitoring infrastructures, bringing the machine learning traffic classification even to 100 Gbps backbone lines.},

This phenomenon is known as Tidal Effect analogy to the rise and fall of the sea levels. Recognizing and deﬁning trafﬁc load patterns at the base station thus plays a vital role in trafﬁc engineering, network design and load balancing since it represents an important solution for the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that face network congestion problems or over-provisioning of the link capacity. Previous works have dealt with the classiﬁcation and identiﬁcation of patterns through the use of techniques, which inspect the ﬂow of data of a particular application. But they assume prior knowledge on the stream of data packets, making the trend identiﬁcation much inefﬁcient. Recent methods based on machine learning techniques build their classiﬁcation models based on sample data collected at certain points of the network with high accuracy. Therefore, in this paper, we address the problem by applying matrix factorization based models on real-world datasets, identifying typical patterns from data streams, which frequently occur in the network, without investigating the type of ﬂows. For that, we propose a Collective Non-negative Matrix Factorization based model combining multi-source data, such as point of interests attributes, trafﬁc data and base station information, identifying the basic patterns of those areas of the city that present the same type of attributes. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared with the baselines.},

	abstract = {By predicting the traffic load on network links, a network operator can effectively pre-dispose resource-allocation strategies to early address, e.g., an incoming congestion event. Traffic loads on different links of a telecom is know to be subject to strong correlation, and this correlation, if properly represented, can be exploited to refine the prediction of future congestion events. Machine Learning (ML) represents nowadays the state-of-the-art methodology for discovering complex relations among data. However, ML has been traditionally applied to data represented in the Euclidean space (e.g., to images) and it may not be straightforward to effectively employ it to model graph-stuctured data (e.g., as the events that take place in telecom networks). Recently, several ML algorithms specifically designed to learn models of graph-structured data have appeared in the literature. The main novelty of these techniques relies on their ability to learn a representation of each node of the graph considering both its properties (e.g., features) and the structure of the network (e.g., the topology). In this paper, we employ a recently-proposed graph-based ML algorithm, the Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (DCRNN), to forecast traffic load on the links of a real backbone network. We evaluate DRCNN's ability to forecast the volume of expected traffic and to predict events of congestion, and we compare this approach to other existing approaches (as LSTM, and Fully-Connected Neural Networks). Results show that DCRN outperforms the other methods both in terms of its forecasting ability (e.g., MAPE is reduced from 210\% to 43\%) and in terms of the prediction of congestion events, and represent promising starting point for the application of DRCNN to other network management problems.},

In this work, we focus on deep learning methods to make prediction of traffic matrices that allow us to proactively optimize the resource allocations of optical backbone networks. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are designed for sequence prediction problems and they achieved great results in the past years in tasks like speech recognition, handwriting recognition and prediction of time series data. We investigated a particular type of RNN, the Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), able to achieve great accuracy ({\textless} 7.4 of mean absolute error). Then, we used the predictions to dynamically and proactively allocate the resources of an optical network. Comparing numerical results of static vs. dynamic allocation based on predictions, we can estimate a saving of 66.3\% of the available capacity in the network, managing unexpected traffic peaks.},

Deep Learning (DL) models have emerged as a promising approach for DDoS attack detection and mitigation due to their capability of automatically learning feature representations and distinguishing complex patterns within network traffic data. However, the effectiveness of DL models in protecting against evolving attacks depends also on the design of adaptive architectures, through the combination of appropriate models, quality data, and thorough hyperparameter optimizations, which are scarcely performed in the literature. Also, within adaptive architectures for DDoS detection, no method has yet addressed how to transfer knowledge between different datasets to improve classification accuracy.

Experimental results on publicly available datasets show that the proposed adaptive transfer learning method effectively identifies benign and malicious activities and specific attack categories.},

The centralized control plane offers comprehensive control and orchestration over the network infrastructure. Although SDN provides better control over traffic flow, ensuring network security and service availability remains challenging. This paper presents an anomaly-based intrusion detection system (IDS) for monitoring and securing SDN networks. The system utilizes deep learning models to identify anomalous traffic behavior. When an anomaly is detected, a mitigation module blocks suspicious communications and restores the network to its normal state. Three versions of the proposed solution were implemented and compared: the traditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN), and Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP). These models were incorporated into the system’s detection structure and tested on two benchmark datasets. The first is emulated, and the second is the well-known CICDDoS2019 dataset. The results indicate that the IDS adequately identified potential threats, regardless of the deep learning algorithm. Although the traditional GAN is a simpler model, it could still efficiently detect when the network was under attack and was considerably faster than the other models. Additionally, the employed mitigation strategy successfully dropped over 89\% of anomalous flows in the emulated dataset and over 99\% in the public dataset, preventing the effects of the threats from being accentuated and jeopardizing the proper functioning of the SDN network.},

This study proposes an anomaly detection system to detect distributed denial of service attacks in software-defined networks using generative adversarial neural networks with gated recurrent units. The proposed system uses unsupervised learning to detect unknown attacks in an interval of 1 second. A mitigation algorithm is also proposed to stop distributed denial-of-service attacks from harming the network’s operation. Two datasets were used to validate this model: the first developed by the computer networks study group Orion from the State University of Londrina. The second is a well-known dataset: CIC-DDoS2019, widely used by the anomaly detection community. Besides the gated recurrent units, other types of neurons are also tested in this work, they are: long short-term memory, convolutional and temporal convolutional.

The slightest failure might cause significant financial losses and sometimes even lives. For this reason, security and management measures against network threats are fundamental and have been researched for years. Software-defined networks (SDN) are an advancement in network management due to their centralization of the control plane, as it facilitates equipment setup and administration over the local network. However, this centralization makes the controller a target to denial of service attacks (DoS). In this study, we aim to develop a network anomaly detection and mitigation system that uses gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural networks combined with fuzzy logic. The neural network is trained to forecast future traffic, and anomalies are detected when the forecasting fails. The system is designed to operate in software-defined networks since they provide network flow information and tools to manage forwarding tables. We also demonstrate how the neural network’s hyperparameters affect the detection module. The system was tested using two datasets: one with emulated traffic generated by the data communication and networking research group called Orion, from computer science department at state university of Londrina, and CICDDoS2019, a well-known dataset by the anomaly detection community.

	abstract = {Network traffic prediction is an important tool for the South African Research and Education Network (SANREN) in managing network congestion, resources and security. It predicts future network traffic flows based on previous data, using either statistical time-series or machine learning approaches. Efficient prediction can improve the quality of service and lower operating costs for network service providers. Existing literature shows that deep learning models learn network traffic patterns more efficiently and predict future traffic more accurately than traditional prediction models. Three different Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models were developed for the SANREN: Bidirectional, Simple and Stacked. These models were evaluated both in terms of their prediction accuracy, and their computational complexity. Dataset size and prediction accuracy have a strong correlation, at the cost of increasing training time as more data are added. The results demonstrated that a Stacked LSTM was the most accurate prediction model, at the expense of using the most computational resources. Using a Simple LSTM greatly saved on computational resources, and was only slightly less accurate at predicting future traffic on the SANREN compared to a Stacked LSTM.},

Therefore, detecting drifts is essential to maintain the quality and effectiveness of these systems. Automatic detectors based on statistical information are usually used to accomplish this task. Optimizing drift detectors through tuning is crucial for effective concept drift analysis. However, relying on user expertise or labeled data for supervised tuning can be challenging. In such cases, the use of unsupervised tuning methods becomes a suitable alternative to adapt detectors to evolving data distributions. To address this gap in the literature an unsupervised tuning method was proposed, leveraging a time series segmentation method. This innovative approach aims to alleviate the reliance on labeled data or user expertise traditionally associated with supervised methods, offering a more adaptive and automated means of tuning detectors. Our results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the default configuration in most evaluated cases. Furthermore, we show that our approach can improve the hyperparameter tuning process when the type of drift is known including supervised methods such as Random Search tuning. By adopting our approach, we can achieve better performance in drift detection and improve the accuracy and reliability of systems that rely on this critical task.},

Although such an approach is appealing, as it requires no modiﬁcation to the existing Internet infrastructure and can scale to handle very large attacks, recent industrial interviews with more than 100 interviewees from over 10 industry segments reveal that this approach alone is not sufﬁcient, especially for large organizations (e.g., web hosting companies, government) that cannot afford to allow third-parity security-service providers to terminate their network connections. Instead, these organizations have to rely on their ISPs to ﬁlter attack trafﬁc.

              We argue that time series analysis is fundamentally different in nature to either vision or natural language processing with respect to the forms of meaningful self-supervised learning tasks that can be defined. Motivated by this insight, we introduce a novel approach called
              Series2Vec
              for self-supervised representation learning. Unlike the state-of-the-art methods in time series which rely on hand-crafted data augmentation, Series2Vec is trained by predicting the similarity between two series in both temporal and spectral domains through a self-supervised task. By leveraging the similarity prediction task, which has inherent meaning for a wide range of time series analysis tasks, Series2Vec eliminates the need for hand-crafted data augmentation. To further enforce the network to learn similar representations for similar time series, we propose a novel approach that applies order-invariant attention to each representation within the batch during training. Our evaluation of Series2Vec on nine large real-world datasets, along with the UCR/UEA archive, shows enhanced performance compared to current state-of-the-art self-supervised techniques for time series. Additionally, our extensive experiments show that Series2Vec performs comparably with fully supervised training and offers high efficiency in datasets with limited-labeled data. Finally, we show that the fusion of Series2Vec with other representation learning models leads to enhanced performance for time series classification. Code and models are open-source at

	abstract = {Volumetric distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks can bring any network to a halt. Because of their distributed nature and high volume, the victim often cannot handle these attacks alone and needs help from upstream ISPs. Today’s Internet has no automated mechanism for victims to ask ISPs for help in attack handling and ISPs themselves do not offer such services. We propose SENSS, a security service for collaborative mitigation of volumetric DDoS attacks. SENSS enables the victim of an attack to request attack monitoring and filtering on demand, and to pay for the services rendered. Requests can be sent both to the immediate and to remote ISPs, in an automated and secure manner, and can be authenticated by these ISPs, without having prior trust with the victim. Simple and generic SENSS APIs enable victims to build custom detection and mitigation approaches against a variety of DDoS attacks. SENSS is deployable with today’s infrastructure, and it has strong economic incentives both for ISPs and for the attack victims. It is also very effective in sparse deployment, offering full protection to direct customers of early adopters, and considerable protection to remote victims when deployed strategically. Deployment on the largest 1\% of ISPs protects not just direct customers of these ISPs, but everyone on the Internet, from 90\% of volumetric DDoS attacks.},

	abstract = {Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a major threat to the Internet of Things (IoT), Software Defined Networks (SDN), and Cloud Computing Networks. Due to the tremendous applications of IoT networks, the number of DDoS attacks is increasing significantly, and most sophisticated DDoS attacks are generated through IoT botnets. An IoT botnet-based DDoS attack can disrupt the network quickly with a surge of malicious traffic. Especially in an SDN network, it is important to detect the DDoS attack before it occurs to the SDN controller. DDoS attacks on the centralized controller of the SDN can disrupt the whole network. So, identifying DDoS attacks at the earliest is a critical security measure for network experts and practitioners. In this paper, we analyze the DDoS attack on an SDN environment and develop a method to identify the DDoS attack using Deep Learning (DL). The proposed method converts the captured raw network traffic to image data and classifies the malicious data from normal data. The method is evaluated on our test-bed simulated dataset and two other benchmark datasets. The experimental comparison shows that the proposed method performs better on all three datasets, giving more than 99\% classification accuracy.},

This paper presents a comparative analysis of DRDoS attacks against victims in Brazil and in the rest of the world.

We describe and contrast several characteristics of DRDoS trafﬁc, including an in-depth analysis of carpet bombing attacks.

The centralized control plane offers comprehensive control and orchestration over the network infrastructure. Although SDN provides better control over traffic flow, ensuring network security and service availability remains challenging. This paper presents an anomaly-based intrusion detection system (IDS) for monitoring and securing SDN networks. The system utilizes deep learning models to identify anomalous traffic behavior. When an anomaly is detected, a mitigation module blocks suspicious communications and restores the network to its normal state. Three versions of the proposed solution were implemented and compared: the traditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN), and Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP). These models were incorporated into the system’s detection structure and tested on two benchmark datasets. The first is emulated, and the second is the well-known CICDDoS2019 dataset. The results indicate that the IDS adequately identified potential threats, regardless of the deep learning algorithm. Although the traditional GAN is a simpler model, it could still efficiently detect when the network was under attack and was considerably faster than the other models. Additionally, the employed mitigation strategy successfully dropped over 89\% of anomalous flows in the emulated dataset and over 99\% in the public dataset, preventing the effects of the threats from being accentuated and jeopardizing the proper functioning of the SDN network.},

	abstract = {Dealing with network security has always been challenging, particularly with regard to the detection and prevention of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Attacks like DDoS bring threats to the network by violating its availability to the probable people who are in need of using that particular server. It is a type of cyber-attack where a network is flooded with a huge amount of traffic, overwhelming the system, and making it unavailable. This type of attack focuses on making the service unavailable to rightful users, without breaching the security perimeter. In a DDoS attack, a master computer hacks a network of vulnerable computers to send a huge quantity of packets to a server from already captured zombie computers. Researchers have suggested various Machine learning (ML) algorithms to detect such attacks. To study and analyse DDoS attacks, researchers have used the CIC-DDoS2019 dataset. To find out how often a DDoS attack happens to a server along with the possible pattern of the attack and type of the attack. This dataset is utilized to train and evaluate ML models for detecting DDoS attacks. In this paper, the primary objective is to propose a decent version of DDoS dataset for investigation and evaluate the performance of various state-of-the-art classifiers, such as Gaussian Naïve Byes (GNB), Bernoulli Naïve Byes (BNB), Random Forest (RF), ID3 Decision Tree (ID3 DT), Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), AdaBoost, CART, and Bagging Classifier ML algorithms to detect DDoS attacks accurately. Along with that, the experimenter showed that DDoS attacks can be identified even more accurately if the attacks are stored in a binary way rather than categorized into 13 different types of attacks in the dataset.},

This is because SDN separates the control and data planes. The centralised control of devices aids in the prevention of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. The controller has a larger network perspective and has the ability to filter network traffic in order to detect harmful flows. The separation of the control and data planes provided benefits, but it is vulnerable to DDoS attacks. DDoS assaults are difficult to detect and resist in real-time. This is only possible if appropriate features for attack detection are chosen. We intend to employ feature selection methods such as BORUTA, IRelief, Random Forest, Information Gain and Chi-Square Test to obtain the most relevant features for DDoS detection. Moreover, we have devised a strategy to detect and mitigate DDoS attack using tracebacking approach through ONOS Flood Defender (OFD) Application. The application effectively detects different DDoS attack traffic using XGBoost and Multilayer Perceptron algorithms with 99\% accuracy and least testing times without adding unnecessary load to the system and mitigates the attack in approximately 3.2 s using tracebacking approach. We have performed our experiment on four benchmark datasets CIC-DoS 2017, CIC-DDoS 2019, CIC-IDS 2018 and InSDN. We have evaluated the trade-off between detection accuracy and testing time in order to determine the most effective detection model for addressing DDoS attacks on SDN networks.},

Even though technologies like DNSSec, DNS over HTTPS/TLS, and DNSCurve have always been suitable for this type of problem, many developers need help to exercise the complete chain of trust. Implementing the mentioned protocols might be a matter of time, inexperience, or impossibility. In this paper, some workarounds that rely on BGP Autonomous System numbers (AS) are shown, and protocols therein are described by way of Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (uRPF), its benefits and drawbacks from an analytical standpoint, as well as the primary flow to defend end systems, are presented. Our approach focuses on filtering malicious traffic closer to the source by identifying anomalies in BGP AS path information. The methodology is implemented and tested using Snort as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to capture and analyze DNS request patterns, then MikroTik router configurations are used for strict uRPF and ingress filtering, demonstrating the practical application of this solution proposed solution in real-world network environments.},

	abstract = {Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks continue to pose a serious threat to the availability of Internet services. The Domain Name System (DNS) is part of the core of the Internet and a crucial factor in the successful delivery of Internet services. Because of the importance of DNS, specialist service providers have sprung up in the market, that provide managed DNS services. One of their key selling points is that they protect DNS for a domain against DDoS attacks. But what if such a service becomes the target of a DDoS attack, and that attack succeeds? In this paper we analyse two such events, an attack on NS1 in May 2016, and an attack on Dyn in October 2016. We do this by analysing the change in the behaviour of the service’s customers. For our analysis we leverage data from the OpenINTEL active DNS measurement system, which covers large parts of the global DNS over time. Our results show an almost immediate and statistically significant change in the behaviour of domains that use NS1 or Dyn as a DNS service provider. We observe a decline in the number of domains that exclusively use NS1 or Dyn as a managed DNS service provider, and see a shift toward risk spreading by using multiple providers. While a large managed DNS provider may be better equipped to protect against attacks, these two case studies show they are not impervious to them. This calls into question the wisdom of using a single provider for managed DNS. Our results show that spreading risk by using multiple providers is an effective countermeasure, albeit probably at a higher cost.},

	abstract = {Evaluating web trafﬁc on a web server is highly critical for web service providers since, without a proper demand forecast, customers could have lengthy waiting times and abandon that website. However, this is a challenging task since it requires making reliable predictions based on the arbitrary nature of human behavior. We introduce an architecture that collects source data and in a supervised way performs the forecasting of the time series of the page views. Based on the Wikipedia page views dataset proposed in a competition by Kaggle in 2017, we created an updated version of it for the years 2018–2020. This dataset is processed and the features and hidden patterns in data are obtained for later designing an advanced version of a recurrent neural network called Long Short-Term Memory. This AI model is distributed training, according to the paradigm called data parallelism and using the Downpour training strategy. Predictions made for the seven dominant languages in the dataset are accurate with loss function and measurement error in reasonable ranges. Despite the fact that the analyzed time series have fairly bad patterns of seasonality and trend, the predictions have been quite good, evidencing that an analysis of the hidden patterns and the features extraction before the design of the AI model enhances the model accuracy. In addition, the improvement of the accuracy of the model with the distributed training is remarkable. Since the task of predicting web trafﬁc in as precise quantities as possible requires large datasets, we designed a forecasting system to be accurate despite having limited data in the dataset. We tested the proposed model on the new Wikipedia page views dataset we created and obtained a highly accurate prediction; actually, the mean absolute error of predictions regarding the original one on average is below 30. This represents a signiﬁcant step forward in the ﬁeld of time series prediction for web trafﬁc forecasting.},

DDoS attacks pose a severe threat to the availability of such online resources – especially owing to booters – virtually everyone can execute them nowadays. In order to appropriately protect oneself against such attacks, it is essential to have a good insight into the threats that exist. This paper proposes a novel hybrid model that combines postulates from various models on crime opportunity, analyzing the targeted victim and the targeted infrastructure in conjunction. We apply this model to analyze 27 distinct attack events that occurred in 2016. To construct this dataset, we utilize a longitudinal news database speciﬁc to DDoS-related events, aiding to select relevant attack events. We outline the procedure to replicate the dataset construction process. Looking at DDoS attacks solely as a technical issue is not enough, news articles can be an important resource in providing contextual relevance to this problem. Our analysis reveals several motives underlying DDoS attacks; economic reasons are but one of the possible aims. For this reason, we advise companies to also monitor the socio-cultural and political environment. In terms of infrastructure, visibility and accessibility are the main instigators for an attack. A holistic perspective is imperative to accurately map the threats that companies face and to take appropriate protective measures.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the automated RADAR system for the malicious trafﬁc detection and the near realtime trafﬁc diversion. RADAR is designed to detect and divert suspicious/malicious trafﬁc (within an enterprise network) to safe locations for further analysis. Current practice requires the manual redirection of malicious trafﬁc, incurs a signiﬁcant amount of human effort, and results in major delay in response. The RADAR system includes network monitoring and trafﬁc ﬁltering/diversion with threat detection, ruleset generation, rule dissemination (similar to Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Flowspec) and threat analysis capabilities. RADAR decouples Flowspec features from BGP routing and provides the ﬂexibility to use any standard routing protocol such as BGP and OSPF to divert the trafﬁc. BGP is used for the purpose of demonstration. A scalable and hybrid network testbed is developed to emulate an enterprise network, where normal and malicious trafﬁc ﬂows, i.e., denial of service (DoS) attacks, are generated. A NetFlow based network monitoring tool is used to provide near real-time trafﬁc speciﬁcation feedback and a ﬂow based intrusion detection system is used to detect DoS TCP SYN attacks. Ruleset generation and diversion mechanisms are developed to construct BGP updates for the redirection of malicious ﬂows. The successful diversion of malicious trafﬁc is demonstrated with Cisco and Linux routers for testing different scenarios in the network testbed.},

	abstract = {The ever expanding the usage of cloud computing environments, connected applications and Internet of Things-based devices have progressively increased the amount of data that travels through our networks. Software-deﬁned network (SDN) is an emergent paradigm that aims to support next-generation networks through its ﬂexible and powerful management mechanisms. One of the biggest threats faced by these services nowadays is security management. Attacks based on the denial of service (DoS) are particularly efﬁcient against this paradigm due to its centralized control characteristic. Once this controlling system receives a massive amount of malicious requests, the overall performance of the network operation is impaired. Although several researches propose to address this problem, most of them are reactive approaches, detecting the attacks and warning the network administrators, i.e., after the network is already compromised. This paper presents an autonomic DoS/DDoS defensive approach for SDNs called Game Theory (GT)-HoltWinters for Digital Signature (HWDS), which unites the anomaly detection and identiﬁcation provided by an HWDS system with an autonomous decision-making model based on GT. Real collected data and simulated attacks are used by the system to measure its effectiveness and efﬁciency. Furthermore, we also use a heuristic Fuzzy-GADS method for anomaly detection instead of HWDS, aiming to compare the achieved performance and evaluate the behavior of the presented game theoretical approaches a standalone mitigation module.},

	abstract = {A wide range of Machine Learning algorithms can model time series to address classification, forecasting, and clustering problems. However, time series may exhibit characteristics that complicate these tasks, such as repeating patterns and seasonal variations. Time series segmentation could be a solution to these problems, but current approaches need to be improved. Most of them employ linear regression to solve problems such as detecting changes in a series’ behavior, bypassing tools specifically designed for these challenges, such as change detectors. Moreover, explainability is seldom taken into account during time series segmentation. To automatically identify different time series patterns using appropriate techniques while leveraging explainability, we proposed the eXplainable Time Series Tree (XTSTree). XTSTree divides a time series into a binary tree, hierarchically splitting it according to a criterion based on change detectors, ideally finding a cutting point that creates the two most different sub-series. The segmentation process continues until it reaches a stop condition, which relies on a stationarity test that assesses whether the series has a sufficiently homogeneous behavior. Based on well-behaved segments, the XTSTree paves the way for a more comprehensive pattern explanation and also supports the application of explainable approaches. Our experimental study applied the XTSTree on several real-life time series to isolate the series’ different behaviors. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we used Symbolic Regression to find the best representation of the time series and its splits using algebraic expressions, comparing the differences before and after the XTSTree. We show an improvement in terms of expression complexity, improving the model accuracy compared to the original time series.},

	abstract = {This paper critically evaluates the use of artificial neural networks as network traffic predictors. Network traffic prediction is crucial for the maintenance and optimization of large, federated networks. Without the ability to forecast traffic trends, networks face congestion and resource mismanagement. These are some of the issues faced by the South African Research and Education Network. To solve these common problems, researchers have begun to use artificial neural networks to make predictions with time-series data. Neural networks are more accurate and efficient than statistical methods, and can recognize long-dependencies and unusual temporal patterns. Various models have been considered for the network traffic prediction problem, including the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, Recurrent Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. The literature shows that the LSTM architecture is the best performing neural network, and is the ideal candidate for further research using data provided by the South African Research and Education Network. Overall, it is concluded that additional research on the Long Short-Term Memory model is needed in two facets. Firstly, it is necessary to evaluate whether the LSTM architecture can be fundamentally changed to produce improved performance. Secondly, the LSTM must be assessed for its appropriateness on the SANReN, and so the computational requirements and efficiency of the LSTM will also be evaluated.},

SDN has emerged as a prominent networking paradigm, providing users with a decoupled control and data plane, which grants greater control and programmability over the network. In comparison to traditional networks, SDN offers dynamic, agile, cost-effective, and manageable solutions. However, a notable drawback of SDN is that the central controller becomes a vulnerable attack surface, rendering it susceptible to complete network takeover through DDoS attacks. The novelty of this paper is to gather resources that will be used to mitigate DDoS attacks in SDN environments. This paper focuses on the exploration of open datasets featuring DDoS attacks, as well as examining attack detection and mitigation techniques and frameworks. By analyzing various detection and mitigation strategies, network administrators and security professionals can make informed decisions to enhance the robustness and resilience of SDN environments in the face of evolving DDoS threats.},

	abstract = {Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks continue to pose a serious threat to the availability of Internet services. The Domain Name System (DNS) is part of the core of the Internet and a crucial factor in the successful delivery of Internet services. Because of the importance of DNS, specialist service providers have sprung up in the market, that provide managed DNS services. One of their key selling points is that they protect DNS for a domain against DDoS attacks. But what if such a service becomes the target of a DDoS attack, and that attack succeeds? In this paper we analyse two such events, an attack on NS1 in May 2016, and an attack on Dyn in October 2016. We do this by analysing the change in the behaviour of the service’s customers. For our analysis we leverage data from the OpenINTEL active DNS measurement system, which covers large parts of the global DNS over time. Our results show an almost immediate and statistically significant change in the behaviour of domains that use NS1 or Dyn as a DNS service provider. We observe a decline in the number of domains that exclusively use NS1 or Dyn as a managed DNS service provider, and see a shift toward risk spreading by using multiple providers. While a large managed DNS provider may be better equipped to protect against attacks, these two case studies show they are not impervious to them. This calls into question the wisdom of using a single provider for managed DNS. Our results show that spreading risk by using multiple providers is an effective countermeasure, albeit probably at a higher cost.},

Unfortunately, remote parties may misuse blackholing [57, 29] and send requests for IPs they do not own, turning a defense technique into a new attack vector. As DDoS attacks grow in number, blackholing will only become more popular, creating a greater risk this service will be exploited. In this work, we develop a taxonomy of attacks combining hijacks with blackholing: BGP blackjacks (blackhole hijacks). We show that those attacks eﬀectively grant more reach and stealth to the attacker than regular hijacks, and assess the usability of those attacks in various security deployments. We then ﬁnd that routing security mechanisms for BGP [30, 31] do not provide an adequate protection against some of those attacks, and propose additional mechanisms to properly defend against or mitigate them.},

For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains.

The slightest failure might cause signiﬁcant ﬁnancial losses and sometimes even lives. For this reason, security and management measures against network threats are fundamental and have been researched for years. Software-deﬁned networks (SDN) are an advancement in network management due to their centralization of the control plane, as it facilitates equipment setup and administration over the local network. However, this centralization makes the controller a target to denial of service attacks (DoS). In this study, we aim to develop a network anomaly detection and mitigation system that uses gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural networks combined with fuzzy logic. The neural network is trained to forecast future trafﬁc, and anomalies are detected when the forecasting fails. The system is designed to operate in software-deﬁned networks since they provide network ﬂow information and tools to manage forwarding tables. We also demonstrate how the neural network’s hyperparameters affect the detection module. The system was tested using two datasets: one with emulated trafﬁc generated by the data communication and networking research group called Orion, from computer science department at state university of Londrina, and CICDDoS2019, a well-known dataset by the anomaly detection community. The results show that GRU networks combined with fuzzy logic are a viable option to detect anomalies in SDN and possibly in other anomaly detection applications.

These applications require more and more network capacity and dynamicity to accomplish their goals. The networks may be targeted by attacks and intrusions that compromise the applications that rely on them and lead to potential losses. We propose a semi-supervised systematic methodology for developing a detection system for traffic volume anomalies in IP flow-based networks. The system is implemented with a vanilla Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The mitigation module is triggered whenever an anomaly is detected, automatically blocking the suspect IPs and restoring the correct network functioning. We implemented three versions of the proposed solution by incorporating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), 1D-Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN), and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) into the GAN internal structure. The experiments are conducted on three public benchmark datasets: Orion, CIC-DDoS2019, and CIC-IDS2017. The results show that the three considered deep learning models have distinct impacts on the GAN model and, consequently, on the overall system performance. The 1D-CNN-based GAN implementation is the best since it reasonably solves the mode collapse problem, has the most efficient computational complexity, and achieves competitive Matthews Correlation Coefficient scores for the anomaly detection task. Also, the mitigation module can drop most anomalous flows, blocking only a slight portion of legitimate traffic. For comparison with state-of-the-art models, we implemented 1D-CNN, LSTM, and TCN separately from the GAN. The generative networks show improved overall results in the considered performance metrics compared to the other models.},

	abstract = {Computer networks facilitate regular human tasks, providing services like data streaming, online shopping, and digital communications. These applications require more and more network capacity and dynamicity to accomplish their goals. The networks may be targeted by attacks and intrusions that compromise the applications that rely on them and lead to potential losses. We propose a semi-supervised systematic methodology for developing a detection system for traffic volume anomalies in IP flow-based networks. The system is implemented with a vanilla Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The mitigation module is triggered whenever an anomaly is detected, automatically blocking the suspect IPs and restoring the correct network functioning. We implemented three versions of the proposed solution by incorporating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), 1D-Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN), and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) into the GAN internal structure. The experiments are conducted on three public benchmark datasets: Orion, CIC-DDoS2019, and CIC-IDS2017. The results show that the three considered deep learning models have distinct impacts on the GAN model and, consequently, on the overall system performance. The 1D-CNN-based GAN implementation is the best since it reasonably solves the mode collapse problem, has the most efficient computational complexity, and achieves competitive Matthews Correlation Coefficient scores for the anomaly detection task. Also, the mitigation module can drop most anomalous flows, blocking only a slight portion of legitimate traffic. For comparison with state-of-the-art models, we implemented 1D-CNN, LSTM, and TCN separately from the GAN. The generative networks show improved overall results in the considered performance metrics compared to the other models.},
